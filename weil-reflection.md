1.What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

 * Conceptually understanding how version control works in practice
 * What situations required pull and push requests
 * How the collaboration process worked on a technical level. Where do we create the shared repository, how is it accessed, how do we create branches and merge them into our project?
 * Application of the Git syntax

2.What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The GPS was great for me in terms of understanding how everything worked conceptually. It answered all of the questions I had regarding how the collaboration process works, as well as how it is used in practice.

3.What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  * I asked my guide about the conceptual side of the challenge. She did a great job at relating it to real projects she's working on, and that helped my understanding immensely.
  * I asked my pair about a lot of things. During the GPS, I mainly asked him about the use of syntax in the context of various situations. I also asked him if we could talk through some of the reasoning behind a couple concepts, and he was more than happy to (like why we used a certain command instead of another, and similar such questions). They were concepts that he understood much better than I, so it was really helpful to me, and I really appreciate it.

4.What still confuses you about Git?

The only thing I can really think of that still confuses me about Git are issues related to when and where to use certain commands. That is less of a 'confusion' and more of something that I will learn with practice.

5.How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was truly a great experience. I learned so much more than I would have expected. My pair went out of his way to schedule additional times that we could go over the material. It also gave me the opportunity to open up and ask more questions, and understand that asking questions is the easiest way to learn things. Talking about concepts with Jim helped me gain an understanding that wouldn't have had without there being somebody there to talk things through.

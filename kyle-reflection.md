#Reflection 

#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?#

I was struggling with merge conflicts and how to resolve them before the GPS.  I also felt a little unsure of how and when Git and Github synced up.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?#

I felt a lot more comfortable dealing with merge conflicts. 

I felt more comfortable navigating Github repositories and working on the process through the site.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?#

I asked a lot of questions about how the data moved upstream/downstream, and when.  Also, I had syntax questions regarding the how the files communicated from git to github.

#What still confuses you about Git?#

I still need a little practice working with merge conflicts, but that just takes perseverance and experience. 

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?#

The first experience was tremendously positive.  Brittney, our guide, was helpful, while still giving us plenty of room to make mistakes.  Adam, my pair, asked really great questions, and I'm confident I learned a whole lot more from this exercise working with him opposed to working alone.
